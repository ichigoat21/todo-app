1
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:36,313
THE WORST PERSON IN THE WORLD

2
00:01:37,042 --> 00:01:40,583
A film in 12 chapters,
a prologue and an epilogue

3
00:01:48,893 --> 00:01:52,990
You've been through the epidermis,
derma and muscles.

4
00:01:53,067 --> 00:01:54,566
PROLOGUE

5
00:01:55,126 --> 00:01:58,333
<i>Julie disappointed herself.
This used to be easy.</i>

6
00:01:59,709 --> 00:02:01,833
<i>She was still among the top students,</i>

7
00:02:02,126 --> 00:02:03,500
<i>but there were too many</i>

8
00:02:03,751 --> 00:02:05,666
<i>interruptions, updates,</i>

9
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,208
<i>feeds,</i>

10
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:09,583
<i>unsolvable global problems.</i>

11
00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:13,500
<i>She sensed</i>

12
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:17,458
<i>a gnawing unease
she had tried to suppress by cramming</i>

13
00:02:17,751 --> 00:02:19,958
<i>by drowning it in digital interference.</i>

14
00:02:23,251 --> 00:02:25,375
<i>This was wrong.
This wasn't her.</i>

15
00:02:26,834 --> 00:02:28,208
<i>She'd chosen medicine</i>

16
00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:32,291
<i>because it was
so hard to gain admission.</i>

17
00:02:32,792 --> 00:02:35,666
<i>Where her excellent grades
actually meant something.</i>

18
00:02:42,126 --> 00:02:43,958
<i>But then she had
a revelation.</i>

19
00:02:44,542 --> 00:02:46,833
<i>Her passion had always been the soul.</i>

20
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:48,916
<i>The mind, not the body.</i>

21
00:02:49,167 --> 00:02:52,291
Surgery is like, so concrete.

22
00:02:52,501 --> 00:02:55,666
It's almost like being a carpenter.

23
00:02:56,334 --> 00:02:57,458
<i>But now...</i>

24
00:02:57,667 --> 00:03:02,458
My passion has always been
what goes on inside — thoughts and feelings.

25
00:03:02,667 --> 00:03:04,791
<i>It was like a window had opened.</i>

26
00:03:05,001 --> 00:03:05,958
Not anatomy.

27
00:03:06,417 --> 00:03:10,583
If psychology will make you happy,
then do it.

28
00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:14,000
I think you're really brave.

29
00:03:14,251 --> 00:03:17,250
I can't take it anymore.
I don't want to.

30
00:03:17,584 --> 00:03:18,958
<i>She left him.</i>

31
00:03:19,834 --> 00:03:20,916
<i>Though he was devastated,</i>

32
00:03:21,126 --> 00:03:25,208
<i>he had to respect
the way she took control of her life.</i>

33
00:03:50,292 --> 00:03:52,583
<i>She observed her fellow students.</i>

34
00:03:52,834 --> 00:03:54,916
<i>Norway's future spiritual advisers.</i>

35
00:03:55,167 --> 00:03:58,166
<i>Mostly girls with borderline
eating disorders.</i>

36
00:03:58,792 --> 00:04:00,541
Say you're at a party.

37
00:04:00,751 --> 00:04:02,958
<i>She still felt trapped in
the role of model student.</i>

38
00:04:03,167 --> 00:04:04,125
<i>All this cramming.</i>

39
00:04:04,334 --> 00:04:06,916
<i>When was life supposed to start?</i>

40
00:04:07,126 --> 00:04:08,333
What's your name?

41
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,333
Julie.

42
00:04:12,542 --> 00:04:14,541
The person's name is Julie.

43
00:04:15,167 --> 00:04:17,750
Let's say Julie and I
meet at a party,

44
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:22,125
and we feel a mutual attraction.

45
00:04:22,334 --> 00:04:23,500
Hypothetically.

46
00:04:36,626 --> 00:04:38,791
<i>Actually, she was a visual person.</i>

47
00:04:40,001 --> 00:04:41,625
Now I know.

48
00:04:42,584 --> 00:04:44,208
I want to be a photographer.

49
00:04:44,709 --> 00:04:45,916
A photographer?

50
00:04:46,709 --> 00:04:47,333
I see.

51
00:04:47,626 --> 00:04:50,958
<i>Julie spent her student loan
on cameras and lenses.</i>

52
00:04:51,251 --> 00:04:52,916
As long as you're serious about it.

53
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:55,916
<i>No safety net. No holding back.</i>

54
00:04:56,334 --> 00:04:57,166
Need help?

55
00:04:57,459 --> 00:04:59,083
<i>She took a temp job
in a bookstore.</i>

56
00:05:00,584 --> 00:05:02,458
<i>Started a photography course.</i>

57
00:05:02,667 --> 00:05:03,291
Super!

58
00:05:04,001 --> 00:05:05,291
<i>She made new friends.</i>

59
00:05:06,042 --> 00:05:07,250
<i>It felt like coming home.</i>

60
00:05:11,209 --> 00:05:13,500
<i>Suddenly Oslo was a different city.</i>

61
00:05:14,001 --> 00:05:16,083
<i>New places. New faces.</i>

62
00:05:16,292 --> 00:05:17,166
Hi. Aksel.

63
00:05:17,376 --> 00:05:18,125
Right...

64
00:05:18,334 --> 00:05:20,208
You're the comic book artist?

65
00:05:20,417 --> 00:05:22,666
<i>She'd heard
he was the creator of Bobcat.</i>

66
00:05:30,084 --> 00:05:31,666
<i>Sorry, I'm a wild animal.</i>

67
00:05:32,251 --> 00:05:33,416
Have you read it?

68
00:05:33,626 --> 00:05:34,416
Yeah.

69
00:05:35,042 --> 00:05:35,916
So?

70
00:05:36,876 --> 00:05:38,708
<i>She pretended she'd read it.</i>

71
00:05:39,292 --> 00:05:43,125
<i>She only remembered one strip
she'd found vaguely sexist.</i>

72
00:05:59,001 --> 00:06:00,125
I know what you mean.

73
00:06:00,334 --> 00:06:02,416
Nothing's ever good enough.

74
00:06:02,626 --> 00:06:05,500
The only thing worse than
all the idiots is yourself.

75
00:06:05,709 --> 00:06:06,500
But...

76
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:11,666
If we go on, I'll fall in love with you.
Then it'll be too late.

77
00:06:13,042 --> 00:06:14,833
Maybe we should agree to...

78
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,708
stop seeing each other.

79
00:06:21,834 --> 00:06:24,583
The problem is our age difference.

80
00:06:24,792 --> 00:06:28,208
I'm just afraid we'll fall into
a vicious circle.

81
00:06:28,417 --> 00:06:30,500
You're much younger than I am.

82
00:06:31,417 --> 00:06:34,291
You'll start to question who you are.

83
00:06:35,376 --> 00:06:38,375
I'm past 40.
I've entered a new phase.

84
00:06:38,584 --> 00:06:41,875
Whereas you still need time
to find yourself.

85
00:06:42,292 --> 00:06:44,625
You don't need me waiting.

86
00:06:44,834 --> 00:06:47,666
You need to be completely free.

87
00:06:48,417 --> 00:06:50,666
I'm just afraid we'll hurt each other.

88
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:01,291
<i>Later she said
that was the precise moment</i>

89
00:07:01,501 --> 00:07:03,625
<i>she fell in love with him.</i>

90
00:07:23,167 --> 00:07:25,750
Shall I put your bag in the bedroom?

91
00:07:26,001 --> 00:07:27,083
Yes, please.

92
00:07:38,251 --> 00:07:39,791
I have two copies of a book!

93
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:41,125
Huh?

94
00:07:41,376 --> 00:07:42,250
Yeah.

95
00:07:43,209 --> 00:07:44,416
I'll throw one away.

96
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:47,208
Can I have two shelves?

97
00:07:49,709 --> 00:07:52,083
How many closets do you need?

98
00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:54,666
How many can I have?

99
00:07:54,917 --> 00:07:57,750
No, that's not how it works.

100
00:07:58,292 --> 00:08:01,125
This is antique glass.
All wavy and stuff.

101
00:08:01,376 --> 00:08:03,750
No, don't do that. Not like that.

102
00:08:04,542 --> 00:08:05,750
No!

103
00:08:06,209 --> 00:08:07,583
Lift this catch here.

104
00:08:08,209 --> 00:08:09,916
I'm terrified it'll break.

105
00:08:10,167 --> 00:08:11,708
I gaze out this window.

106
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,833
- No way!
- I'm not kidding.

107
00:08:14,084 --> 00:08:16,915
Hey, that's how relationships work.

108
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:21,375
She's a bit frosty towards me.
That's new.

109
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:25,333
Yeah? Why do you think that is?

110
00:08:25,626 --> 00:08:27,583
It's embarrassing to say.

111
00:08:27,834 --> 00:08:29,875
We've been single together.

112
00:08:30,876 --> 00:08:32,750
Lived that life.

113
00:08:33,001 --> 00:08:35,625
Then suddenly I move in with you.

114
00:08:36,334 --> 00:08:38,541
- And you're happy?
- Yeah.

115
00:08:39,584 --> 00:08:40,958
No, no, no...

116
00:08:41,542 --> 00:08:43,416
Did you date this guy?

117
00:08:43,709 --> 00:08:45,208
Yeah, just a fling.

118
00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:47,666
Okay.

119
00:08:48,251 --> 00:08:49,458
Stop!

120
00:08:52,209 --> 00:08:53,833
You're so predictable!

121
00:08:54,542 --> 00:08:56,083
Let's just fuck.

122
00:09:14,626 --> 00:09:15,583
Hello!

123
00:09:16,667 --> 00:09:20,166
CHAPTER 1
THE OTHERS

124
00:09:22,834 --> 00:09:25,041
- Happy to see you!
- Me, too.

125
00:09:25,251 --> 00:09:26,666
- Doing good?
- Yeah.

126
00:09:28,042 --> 00:09:28,750
Hi, Martin.

127
00:09:29,334 --> 00:09:30,041
Welcome.

128
00:09:30,251 --> 00:09:31,625
Thanks for coming.

129
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,416
Dad designed it.

130
00:09:36,667 --> 00:09:40,541
We should renovate,
but don't want to change anything.

131
00:09:40,792 --> 00:09:42,625
It's beautiful.

132
00:09:43,042 --> 00:09:45,875
Yeah, but there's stuff like that. Damp.

133
00:09:55,126 --> 00:09:58,458
We get this room
because we're childless.

134
00:09:58,667 --> 00:09:59,916
Dibs on the top bunk.

135
00:10:01,376 --> 00:10:04,083
I always feel that Tone doesn't like me.

136
00:10:04,292 --> 00:10:05,833
She's just shy.

137
00:10:08,251 --> 00:10:10,583
That's what you say about boring people.

138
00:10:11,626 --> 00:10:13,583
- It's my turn now.
- Okay.

139
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:17,916
Thank you.

140
00:10:18,167 --> 00:10:19,208
Vin?

141
00:10:20,209 --> 00:10:21,125
Vin de blanc?

142
00:10:21,376 --> 00:10:22,291
Thanks.

143
00:10:25,001 --> 00:10:28,458
Do you have any friends with kids yet?

144
00:10:30,126 --> 00:10:32,083
No. Only one.

145
00:10:32,292 --> 00:10:34,500
Guess this feels unfamiliar.

146
00:10:36,292 --> 00:10:38,875
- They're very sweet.
- Thanks.

147
00:10:39,126 --> 00:10:41,250
So what are you doing now, Julie?

148
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:44,875
Aksel says you've started writing?

149
00:10:45,334 --> 00:10:48,541
Well, I wouldn't exactly
call it writing.

150
00:10:49,126 --> 00:10:49,916
Being modest?

151
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:51,916
No.

152
00:10:52,167 --> 00:10:53,333
Seems so.

153
00:10:53,584 --> 00:10:57,833
Is there anything you'd like to do,

154
00:10:58,334 --> 00:11:00,208
as a career?

155
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:02,250
Questions, questions, Karianne.

156
00:11:02,501 --> 00:11:05,333
That question was vulgar
when we were students.

157
00:11:05,626 --> 00:11:06,208
Lucky you!

158
00:11:06,459 --> 00:11:07,625
Yeah, we were.

159
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:10,083
True, we had a lot of freedom.

160
00:11:10,584 --> 00:11:12,250
Being young today is different.

161
00:11:12,876 --> 00:11:14,791
The pressure is heart-breaking.

162
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:17,208
There's no time to think.

163
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:19,166
Always something on the screen.

164
00:11:19,376 --> 00:11:21,083
Take William.

165
00:11:21,292 --> 00:11:25,333
If we don't set limits,
he spends his life on screens.

166
00:11:29,834 --> 00:11:31,250
Nice try.

167
00:11:31,542 --> 00:11:32,375
Okay.

168
00:11:33,084 --> 00:11:34,375
No, it's not your turn.

169
00:11:34,667 --> 00:11:36,666
It's Martin's turn.

170
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,583
Julie's still the closest.

171
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:49,458
Bedtime.

172
00:11:51,584 --> 00:11:53,125
- She's exhausted.
- No!

173
00:11:53,376 --> 00:11:54,958
No!

174
00:11:55,167 --> 00:11:56,083
- Yes!
- No!

175
00:11:56,459 --> 00:11:58,625
I don't want to go to bed!

176
00:11:59,709 --> 00:12:01,833
I don't want to!

177
00:12:02,084 --> 00:12:05,375
Eva, don't make another scene.
Come here!

178
00:12:05,584 --> 00:12:07,916
No! I don't want to!

179
00:12:13,042 --> 00:12:14,125
Let go!

180
00:12:15,417 --> 00:12:18,166
- You silly girl!
- I don't want to!

181
00:12:18,376 --> 00:12:19,875
But I want you to!

182
00:12:20,084 --> 00:12:21,500
I don't want to!

183
00:12:28,917 --> 00:12:30,291
Kids can be intense.

184
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:32,416
Well, it's okay.

185
00:12:34,501 --> 00:12:36,291
- Fun with kids.
- Yeah.

186
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:40,625
Can't we just enjoy it?

187
00:12:40,834 --> 00:12:43,333
Please. No fights.

188
00:12:43,542 --> 00:12:46,333
There are kids here, and it's chaos.

189
00:12:46,542 --> 00:12:47,625
Just try.

190
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:50,625
Try playing with them
or something, okay?

191
00:12:51,834 --> 00:12:52,708
Please.

192
00:12:52,917 --> 00:12:54,375
Spare me the kid talk.

193
00:12:54,584 --> 00:12:57,708
Sorry, but I wasn't the one who started.

194
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:03,500
You're with someone who's
younger than you. There's a gap.

195
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:07,791
You're almost 30.
Not a bad age to have kids.

196
00:13:09,417 --> 00:13:12,458
I'm 44. I want to go to the next level.
With you.

197
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:15,958
It has nothing to do with my friends.

198
00:13:16,709 --> 00:13:20,916
You seem to be waiting for something.
I don't know what.

199
00:13:21,292 --> 00:13:22,000
Hello?

200
00:13:22,584 --> 00:13:24,250
Jeez.

201
00:13:24,667 --> 00:13:26,541
I didn't want to get into this.

202
00:13:27,126 --> 00:13:28,625
Really not.

203
00:13:31,501 --> 00:13:34,166
Everything's on your terms.

204
00:13:34,792 --> 00:13:36,625
You have time off,
so we're on holiday.

205
00:13:36,834 --> 00:13:38,000
You agreed.

206
00:13:38,334 --> 00:13:41,208
After you publish, you get bored.

207
00:13:41,417 --> 00:13:43,166
And start talking about kids.

208
00:13:43,376 --> 00:13:47,083
The others here have kids,
so it's an issue.

209
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:48,625
Not true.

210
00:13:48,834 --> 00:13:50,416
It is true.

211
00:13:51,584 --> 00:13:52,708
And then...

212
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,708
you get a new idea at some point,

213
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,583
and disappear into your drawing board.

214
00:13:57,792 --> 00:13:59,333
What are you saying?

215
00:13:59,709 --> 00:14:01,833
Don't start. It's not cool.

216
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:03,500
Shut up. Please.

217
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:06,833
Of course I'd be there if we had kids.

218
00:14:07,042 --> 00:14:09,958
You know that.
You know I want children.

219
00:14:10,167 --> 00:14:13,958
Sure, and I'll also want kids
at some point.

220
00:14:14,167 --> 00:14:15,541
But I don't know...

221
00:14:15,751 --> 00:14:18,250
I have no maternal instinct, right?

222
00:14:18,584 --> 00:14:21,791
No, you'd make a great mom.

223
00:14:22,584 --> 00:14:23,333
I'm sure of it.

224
00:14:23,542 --> 00:14:26,291
I want to have children, too.

225
00:14:27,042 --> 00:14:28,250
At some point.

226
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:32,083
So what are we waiting for?
What has to happen first?

227
00:14:33,834 --> 00:14:36,416
I don't know what exactly.

228
00:14:39,334 --> 00:14:41,375
I just want to do more first.

229
00:14:41,584 --> 00:14:43,666
Okay, like what?

230
00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:45,458
What's the obstacle?

231
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:48,083
I don't know! Why do you ask?

232
00:14:48,292 --> 00:14:50,416
Your concept is flawed.

233
00:14:51,376 --> 00:14:55,208
Most people have kids without
sorting out their life first.

234
00:14:55,417 --> 00:14:57,791
- They figure it out.
- Flawed?

235
00:14:58,001 --> 00:15:00,375
That's how most people do it.

236
00:15:00,584 --> 00:15:05,083
But I don't want everything
to happen on your terms,

237
00:15:05,292 --> 00:15:06,458
based on what you want.

238
00:15:06,667 --> 00:15:09,333
Fine. I got it.
But what do you want?

239
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:11,666
Oh, please! We have to stop.

240
00:15:14,584 --> 00:15:17,708
I need sleep
to put up with those people.

241
00:15:49,792 --> 00:15:54,041
I know a guy
who has a theory about that.

242
00:15:55,292 --> 00:15:57,666
He says we have
a limited number of sperm.

243
00:15:58,126 --> 00:16:01,208
Say... three trillion in your lifetime.

244
00:16:01,417 --> 00:16:02,458
Jerk off too much...

245
00:16:03,167 --> 00:16:05,208
and you run out.
Could be true.

246
00:16:05,417 --> 00:16:07,416
Easy now, Portnoy.

247
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:08,958
How fascinating.

248
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:11,250
Personally, I feel like

249
00:16:11,501 --> 00:16:14,916
I know everything
about male problems.

250
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,416
Erectile dysfunction,

251
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:19,583
morning wood,
infatuation with young women...

252
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:21,750
premature ejaculation...

253
00:16:22,042 --> 00:16:22,916
Nice work, Aksel.

254
00:16:25,167 --> 00:16:27,041
It's in all the books and movies.

255
00:16:27,292 --> 00:16:30,208
Where's the menstrual period?

256
00:16:30,459 --> 00:16:32,791
Female orgasm and desire? Where?

257
00:16:33,001 --> 00:16:35,902
Good question. Tell us.
In juicy detail.

258
00:16:36,209 --> 00:16:37,291
No, the point is

259
00:16:37,792 --> 00:16:39,916
it shouldn't be taboo.

260
00:16:40,126 --> 00:16:43,833
If men had periods,
that's all we'd hear about.

261
00:16:47,001 --> 00:16:48,500
Can you womansplain it

262
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,041
a bit better?

263
00:16:50,292 --> 00:16:51,666
What do you mean?

264
00:16:52,542 --> 00:16:55,499
Like mansplaining, but womansplaining.

265
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:57,083
What?

266
00:16:57,292 --> 00:16:58,666
Mansplaining is...

267
00:17:00,417 --> 00:17:03,874
When a 45-year-old man explains

268
00:17:04,334 --> 00:17:06,374
how things really are
to a younger woman.

269
00:17:07,042 --> 00:17:08,166
Nice demonstration!

270
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:09,624
My pleasure.

271
00:17:10,292 --> 00:17:11,041
Ding! Great!

272
00:17:11,334 --> 00:17:12,749
Whiskey, anyone?

273
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:26,875
How's the senior citizen club doing?

274
00:18:01,459 --> 00:18:02,625
Come on.

275
00:18:36,917 --> 00:18:39,333
Look who's here!

276
00:19:02,834 --> 00:19:03,916
Are you okay?

277
00:19:04,126 --> 00:19:05,333
Not really.

278
00:19:06,417 --> 00:19:07,583
Show me.

279
00:19:09,001 --> 00:19:09,833
No!

280
00:19:10,042 --> 00:19:11,875
Let me see...

281
00:19:16,792 --> 00:19:20,166
We'll laugh about it later.
It's just a scratch.

282
00:19:20,417 --> 00:19:22,500
Karianne's such a drama queen.

283
00:19:22,709 --> 00:19:24,250
It's my fault.

284
00:19:24,459 --> 00:19:26,625
Not at all, Julie.

285
00:19:27,459 --> 00:19:30,125
It is. I always overdo it.

286
00:19:30,876 --> 00:19:35,041
I know being here isn't easy for you.

287
00:19:35,251 --> 00:19:39,833
I'm not into this whole
"happy family" thing either.

288
00:19:41,126 --> 00:19:43,625
I'm glad it turned into a party tonight.

289
00:19:45,459 --> 00:19:47,125
I hope you had fun!

290
00:19:47,334 --> 00:19:49,500
What the hell's wrong with you?

291
00:19:50,834 --> 00:19:53,875
What's wrong with having a little fun?

292
00:19:54,084 --> 00:19:56,000
I didn't have any fun!

293
00:19:56,209 --> 00:19:57,750
Sorry that happened.

294
00:19:57,959 --> 00:20:01,916
You don't care!

295
00:20:02,126 --> 00:20:04,291
Shut up! Just shut up!

296
00:20:04,917 --> 00:20:08,416
You don't give a shit about me!

297
00:20:12,001 --> 00:20:13,708
Shall we make a baby?

298
00:20:16,292 --> 00:20:17,125
Fuck you.

299
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:32,041
- Hi.
- Good morning.

300
00:20:32,251 --> 00:20:34,416
There's coffee. And cups.

301
00:22:04,251 --> 00:22:07,958
CHAPTER 2
CHEATING

302
00:22:09,584 --> 00:22:11,125
Sorry, I forgot.

303
00:22:11,376 --> 00:22:13,041
What's your line of work?

304
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:15,750
I work in a bookstore.

305
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,583
Which one?

306
00:22:18,459 --> 00:22:20,750
Norli, by the university.

307
00:22:22,417 --> 00:22:25,000
Could you excuse me for a moment?

308
00:22:27,959 --> 00:22:29,041
Could you sign?

309
00:22:29,459 --> 00:22:31,333
Sure, I'll just finish this.

310
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:33,750
Any new Bobcat in the pipeline?

311
00:22:34,584 --> 00:22:36,041
I've moved on.

312
00:22:36,417 --> 00:22:38,916
Do you work full-time there,

313
00:22:39,126 --> 00:22:41,916
or are you just temping on weekends?

314
00:23:00,792 --> 00:23:02,083
- Sorry.
- Bye.

315
00:23:03,459 --> 00:23:06,041
Hey, I think I'll head home.

316
00:23:06,376 --> 00:23:07,500
Okay.

317
00:23:08,042 --> 00:23:09,208
- You good?
- Yeah.

318
00:23:09,417 --> 00:23:11,166
- Sure?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

319
00:23:11,709 --> 00:23:14,000
- I can stay if you like.
- It's okay.

320
00:23:14,709 --> 00:23:18,041
- But I have to stay a bit longer.
- Of course.

321
00:23:19,209 --> 00:23:21,166
Okay. See you at home.

322
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:45,166
Hi. Can I have a smoke?

323
00:25:45,376 --> 00:25:46,625
Of course.

324
00:26:35,209 --> 00:26:38,458
I had my second child
ten years later.

325
00:26:38,667 --> 00:26:42,583
Now we're supposed
to introduce solids at 4 months.

326
00:26:42,792 --> 00:26:47,375
What made the pediatricians
change their minds?

327
00:26:47,584 --> 00:26:50,958
- Do you cuddle your kids?
- Sure, a lot.

328
00:26:51,167 --> 00:26:52,791
They'll be drug addicts.

329
00:26:55,001 --> 00:26:57,333
They'll be addicts
because I cuddle them?

330
00:26:57,542 --> 00:27:00,458
Yeah, according to new research.

331
00:27:00,667 --> 00:27:04,500
New research says
you shouldn't cuddle your kids?

332
00:27:04,709 --> 00:27:09,125
I realize it must be counter-intuitive
for a mother.

333
00:27:09,334 --> 00:27:11,833
But motherhood upsets
your limbic system.

334
00:27:12,042 --> 00:27:14,458
So my kids are going to be drug addicts?

335
00:27:15,001 --> 00:27:17,125
That's ridiculous.
Do you have children?

336
00:27:17,459 --> 00:27:21,666
No, but I'm a doctor.
I have a medical perspective.

337
00:27:21,876 --> 00:27:26,000
Babies express themselves by crying.

338
00:27:26,376 --> 00:27:30,625
It's normal for a mother or a father
to comfort them.

339
00:28:06,376 --> 00:28:07,291
Hi.

340
00:28:11,292 --> 00:28:13,541
Not asking me the usual questions?

341
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:16,708
- Which ones?
- Who I am, what I do.

342
00:28:17,709 --> 00:28:19,708
Who are you? What do you do?

343
00:28:19,917 --> 00:28:22,291
I hate those questions.

344
00:28:22,501 --> 00:28:25,708
They're especially bad
when you're a doctor.

345
00:28:25,917 --> 00:28:27,125
Are you a doctor?

346
00:28:27,751 --> 00:28:28,958
No, you are.

347
00:28:38,959 --> 00:28:40,666
Which questions should I ask?

348
00:28:46,667 --> 00:28:49,083
Ask me who I know here.

349
00:28:50,001 --> 00:28:52,583
- Who do you know here?
- Nobody.

350
00:28:53,834 --> 00:28:55,083
I crashed the party.

351
00:28:55,959 --> 00:28:57,250
You just waltzed in?

352
00:28:59,917 --> 00:29:00,875
Okay.

353
00:29:25,292 --> 00:29:26,541
Nothing's gonna happen.

354
00:29:26,751 --> 00:29:27,791
Of course not.

355
00:29:28,001 --> 00:29:29,541
I'm with someone I love.

356
00:29:29,751 --> 00:29:30,708
Me, too.

357
00:29:31,126 --> 00:29:34,875
And I can't stand cheating.
I've been there. Never again.

358
00:29:35,376 --> 00:29:38,041
- Right, cheating is...
- No good.

359
00:29:46,459 --> 00:29:48,333
But where do you draw the line?

360
00:29:51,584 --> 00:29:53,000
You can feel it.

361
00:29:53,209 --> 00:29:54,541
If I do this...

362
00:29:59,501 --> 00:30:00,791
Is that cheating?

363
00:30:01,001 --> 00:30:01,958
No.

364
00:30:06,251 --> 00:30:07,916
What about this?

365
00:30:14,501 --> 00:30:16,458
- No, that's permissible.
- Is it?

366
00:30:23,917 --> 00:30:26,208
And hurting someone
who's not your partner?

367
00:30:26,417 --> 00:30:28,791
- You hurt your partner?
- Is that cheating?

368
00:30:32,167 --> 00:30:33,291
Did that hurt?

369
00:30:36,834 --> 00:30:37,833
Did it?

370
00:30:48,292 --> 00:30:50,208
- Feel good?
- Yeah, it did.

371
00:30:51,542 --> 00:30:52,458
Okay.

372
00:30:54,626 --> 00:30:55,875
Let me smell your sweat.

373
00:30:56,084 --> 00:30:57,375
- No.
- Yes.

374
00:30:58,959 --> 00:31:01,541
- Seriously?
- Yes, that's allowed.

375
00:31:09,376 --> 00:31:11,333
- It stinks!
- Yes.

376
00:31:11,917 --> 00:31:14,583
The kind of smell you never forget.

377
00:31:15,876 --> 00:31:18,500
My turn to smell you.

378
00:31:20,417 --> 00:31:22,583
No, please.
I regret it now.

379
00:31:22,792 --> 00:31:23,791
Let me smell.

380
00:31:32,626 --> 00:31:34,250
I think you smell nice.

381
00:31:52,459 --> 00:31:53,916
I don't know if...

382
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:02,166
this is permissible.

383
00:32:07,042 --> 00:32:08,375
Go ahead.

384
00:32:08,584 --> 00:32:09,250
Okay.

385
00:32:09,459 --> 00:32:11,500
You start,
then I'll go next.

386
00:32:12,834 --> 00:32:16,958
I actually think sex is best

387
00:32:17,251 --> 00:32:19,541
when the dick isn't too hard.

388
00:32:21,834 --> 00:32:23,208
Because...

389
00:32:23,959 --> 00:32:26,875
in a way, then I'm the one

390
00:32:27,376 --> 00:32:30,916
who makes it hard, you know?

391
00:32:34,126 --> 00:32:36,250
My secret will be dumb now.

392
00:32:37,209 --> 00:32:39,291
I guess I misunderstood.

393
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:43,583
I was going to say
I like the Barcode Project.

394
00:32:45,584 --> 00:32:48,375
It looks pretty from the bridge
when I go to work.

395
00:32:48,584 --> 00:32:51,375
I expose my darkest secrets,
and you...

396
00:32:51,584 --> 00:32:54,208
You said "secrets",
not "darkest".

397
00:32:54,417 --> 00:32:55,625
So why is that a secret?

398
00:32:55,834 --> 00:32:58,708
Because everyone thinks it's ugly.

399
00:33:07,709 --> 00:33:09,750
Sorry, we're...

400
00:33:29,917 --> 00:33:31,916
- Can I whisper it?
- Okay.

401
00:33:53,126 --> 00:33:54,166
What?

402
00:33:58,751 --> 00:34:02,875
Sorry, I seem to
be sitting on everything.

403
00:34:03,209 --> 00:34:04,333
My bad.

404
00:34:32,042 --> 00:34:33,958
There's nothing sexual about that.

405
00:34:34,584 --> 00:34:35,666
Not at all.

406
00:34:40,417 --> 00:34:42,708
Although you do like soft dicks.

407
00:34:43,167 --> 00:34:44,125
Yeah.

408
00:34:45,042 --> 00:34:45,916
Okay. Your turn.

409
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:02,666
I can't pee.

410
00:35:02,959 --> 00:35:04,791
Just relax.

411
00:36:15,542 --> 00:36:16,708
I'm going this way.

412
00:36:20,542 --> 00:36:21,583
Okay.

413
00:36:29,042 --> 00:36:30,166
What's your name?

414
00:36:31,376 --> 00:36:32,375
Julie.

415
00:36:32,584 --> 00:36:34,125
- I'm Eivind. Eivind...
- Don't say it.

416
00:36:35,751 --> 00:36:36,666
Why not?

417
00:36:36,917 --> 00:36:39,875
I'll find you on Facebook, and...

418
00:36:40,167 --> 00:36:41,208
Good thinking.

419
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:44,375
Okay.

420
00:36:45,126 --> 00:36:46,375
- Bye.
- Bye.

421
00:36:47,792 --> 00:36:49,583
- We didn't cheat.
- No.

422
00:36:49,834 --> 00:36:51,000
- Not at all.
- No.

423
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:52,125
Bye.

426
00:37:55,626 --> 00:37:57,416
Aksel, I need to tell you something.

427
00:37:57,876 --> 00:37:58,833
Aksel?

This is good.

440
00:39:30,126 --> 00:39:31,708
- Yeah?
- It's over the top.

441
00:39:32,501 --> 00:39:36,208
I don't agree with everything,
but it's very well written.

442
00:39:36,417 --> 00:39:38,583
Original. Very good.

443
00:39:38,917 --> 00:39:40,458
What will you do with it?

444
00:39:41,292 --> 00:39:42,500
I don't know.

445
00:39:45,667 --> 00:39:47,208
You really think it's good?

446
00:39:47,501 --> 00:39:49,125
Yeah. Absolutely.

447
00:39:49,876 --> 00:39:51,000
You sure?

448
00:39:51,251 --> 00:39:52,833
Yeah, I'm not lying.

449

No?

450
00:40:00,917 --> 00:40:02,000
Are you sure?

451
00:40:02,209 --> 00:40:04,500
Don't you dare doubt it.

452
00:40:06,167 --> 00:40:08,083
It's pretty cerebral.

453
00:40:08,876 --> 00:40:12,000
But it turns me on too.

454
00:40:12,334 --> 00:40:13,708
- Right?
- Kinda.

455
00:40:14,459 --> 00:40:15,750
Is that why you wrote it?

456
00:40:16,876 --> 00:40:18,000
Intellectual Viagra?

457
00:40:18,209 --> 00:40:20,458
- Yeah.
- It works.

How nice to see you.

472
00:41:08,959 --> 00:41:10,791
- It's been too long.
- Way too long.

473
00:41:11,376 --> 00:41:13,833
<i>Anyway, have a nice birthday.</i>

474
00:41:14,042 --> 00:41:15,125
Thanks.

00:41:15,376 --> 00:41:16,333
Okay.

476
00:41:17,167 --> 00:41:18,458
I'm too skinny?

477
00:41:18,709 --> 00:41:20,500
- You work too much.
- True.

478
00:41:20,834 --> 00:41:22,666
We'll talk later.

479
00:41:24,542 --> 00:41:26,250
Happy birthday!

480
00:41:28,626 --> 00:41:32,125
- Why do I always have to go see him?
- He's not coming?

481
00:41:33,417 --> 00:41:35,458
Well, he's got a backache.

482
00:41:35,667 --> 00:41:38,708
There's always something wrong with him.

483
00:41:39,376 --> 00:41:40,083
Hello!

484
00:41:41,001 --> 00:41:42,958
So, he's not coming.

485
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:44,916
That's not nice.

486
00:41:45,126 --> 00:41:47,500
He wanted to, but he has a backache.

487
00:41:50,001 --> 00:41:52,375
Does he realize how it makes you feel?

488
00:41:53,292 --> 00:41:55,166
- He's...
- It's a backache, Mom.

489

Sorry.

with it, but...

520
00:43:41,417 --> 00:43:45,833
It's getting harder and harder to pee.

521

- Yeah.

524
00:43:55,417 --> 00:43:56,583
Still...

525
00:43:58,459 --> 00:44:00,208
I go to the toilet all the time.

526
00:44:00,459 --> 00:44:01,375
And...

527
00:44:01,959 --> 00:44:03,000
there's leakage.

528
00:44:05,876 --> 00:44:08,291
Thanks for the cool jacket.
Good timing.

529
00:44:08,584 --> 00:44:11,333
I want to get into hiking.

530
00:44:15,876 --> 00:44:17,541
Sorry we're late.

531
00:44:21,626 --> 00:44:23,416
You didn't make them coffee?

532
00:44:23,709 --> 00:44:25,083
It's okay.

533
00:44:25,584 --> 00:44:28,041
I'll fix something.

534
00:44:28,334 --> 00:44:29,625
- How'd it go?
- Great.

535
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:31,875
- How many saves?
- Lots.

536
00:44:32,209 --> 00:44:33,041
Good job.

537
00:44:33,334 --> 00:44:34,875
Happy belated birthday.

538
00:44:35,167 --> 00:44:36,833
30 is pretty major.

539

541
00:44:42,292 --> 00:44:43,541
So we couldn't come.

542
00:44:44,084 --> 00:44:46,583
No problem. That's okay.

543
00:44:47,001 --> 00:44:49,916
She's the goalkeeper.
You should see her play.

544
00:44:50,334 --> 00:44:52,708
No, she doesn't have to.

545
00:44:53,959 --> 00:44:55,750
She's awesome.

546
00:44:56,042 --> 00:44:57,708
I'll let you know next time.

547
00:44:57,959 --> 00:44:59,500
Yeah, please do.

548
00:45:00,709 --> 00:45:01,875
Cool.

549
00:45:04,626 --> 00:45:06,750
Did you get the article I sent you?

550
00:45:08,084 --> 00:45:12,416
Yeah, I was about to ask you.
I couldn't get the link to work.

551
00:45:13,334 --> 00:45:15,041
My PC acts up.

552
00:45:16,126 --> 00:45:18,625
Know anything about computers?

553
00:45:18,834 --> 00:45:21,166
I can take a look.

554
00:45:22,001 --> 00:45:24,875
But can't she just resend the email?

555
00:45:25,084 --> 00:45:26,625
Wasn't there a...

556
00:45:26,834 --> 00:45:28,500
Did she send it
in an email?

557
00:45:28,709 --> 00:45:31,041
An attachment to an email.

558
00:45:32,251 --> 00:45:35,333
No, I pressed the button on the mouse.

559
00:45:35,584 --> 00:45:38,625
Then I put the arrow on the square.

560
00:45:38,876 --> 00:45:41,750
I tried twice, then it vanished.

561
00:45:42,001 --> 00:45:45,291
It could be my fault.

562
00:45:45,584 --> 00:45:48,333
Maybe I sent the wrong version.

563
00:45:48,626 --> 00:45:51,583
We'll fix it.
You have to read that article.

564
00:45:51,792 --> 00:45:53,875
It's really good.

565
00:45:54,292 --> 00:45:55,375
Very...

566
00:45:55,667 --> 00:45:58,416
Very well written, and...

567
00:45:59,626 --> 00:46:01,041
Clever girl.

568
00:46:03,834 --> 00:46:07,375
When are you coming to see us,
Per Harald?

569
00:46:07,751 --> 00:46:11,041
We'd love it.
Come see where your daughter lives.

570
00:46:11,251 --> 00:46:13,375
Sure, of course.

571
00:46:14,334 --> 00:46:16,625
But it's hard to park in Central Oslo.

572
00:46:17,667 --> 00:46:19,208
They've got that...

573
00:46:20,751 --> 00:46:21,875
resident...

574
00:46:22,084 --> 00:46:24,541
resident parking there.

575
00:46:25,084 --> 00:46:25,916
Yeah.

576
00:46:26,667 --> 00:46:29,333
It's made it much easier
to find a space.

577
00:46:29,584 --> 00:46:31,250
You just have to pay.

578
00:46:31,542 --> 00:46:35,250
And move the car every half hour?

579
00:46:37,501 --> 00:46:41,000
Is that the reason
you don't come to see us?

580
00:46:41,792 --> 00:46:44,125
Because it's hard to drive in town?

581
00:46:44,417 --> 00:46:45,250
That's not it.

582
00:46:45,542 --> 00:46:46,625
Then what is it?

583
00:46:47,042 --> 00:46:49,708
Well, you know...

584
00:46:50,126 --> 00:46:53,625
with my painkillers,
I'm not allowed to drive.

585
00:46:53,917 --> 00:46:55,625
There's that, too.

586
00:47:02,626 --> 00:47:05,375
The good thing is,
he's open about it.

587
00:47:05,584 --> 00:47:08,750
His pains. His prostate.

588
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:19,750
You have to make your own family.

589
00:47:30,459 --> 00:47:37,000
CHAPTER 5
BAD TIMING

590
00:48:13,709 --> 00:48:14,708
Excuse me?

591
00:48:15,209 --> 00:48:15,958
Hi.

592
00:48:16,167 --> 00:48:17,666
Do you have <i>Green Yoga</i>?

593
00:48:21,584 --> 00:48:23,083
Let me check.

594
00:48:23,542 --> 00:48:25,833
- Which book again?
- <i>Green Yoga.</i>

595
00:48:26,376 --> 00:48:27,958
Published last year.

596
00:48:31,042 --> 00:48:34,750
No, I'll have to order it.
It's not in stock.

597
00:48:35,001 --> 00:48:36,666
How long will it take?

598
00:48:37,542 --> 00:48:38,666
Two weeks.

599
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:41,916
Okay. No thanks.

600
00:48:43,292 --> 00:48:44,791
They don't have it either.

601
00:48:45,084 --> 00:48:46,041
Okay.

602
00:48:46,292 --> 00:48:48,000
We can try at Ark.

603
00:48:49,001 --> 00:48:49,750
Thank you.

604
00:49:15,959 --> 00:49:17,625
I told her
I forgot my sunglasses.

605
00:49:17,876 --> 00:49:19,500
I just had to say

606
00:49:20,334 --> 00:49:21,750
that I know what we said.

607
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:24,166
But I think about you a lot.

608
00:49:25,334 --> 00:49:26,291
And...

609
00:49:26,834 --> 00:49:29,250
I don't want to bug you
if you're happy.

610
00:49:30,459 --> 00:49:31,416
Are you?

611
00:49:34,126 --> 00:49:36,250
- I don't know what to say.
- Say nothing.

612
00:49:37,167 --> 00:49:40,041
I'd like to see you again.
Just to talk.

613
00:49:41,792 --> 00:49:44,000
I mean, I'm not going to...

614
00:49:45,334 --> 00:49:49,750
But I'd like to see you again.
Just to...

615
00:49:50,626 --> 00:49:53,875
I'm at Åpent Bakeri in Barcode
nearly every day.

616
00:49:55,042 --> 00:49:57,375
I work there, I mean.
If you want to.

617
00:50:00,709 --> 00:50:01,750
So...

618
00:50:05,042 --> 00:50:06,166
- Eivind?
- Yes.

619
00:50:06,792 --> 00:50:07,750
Your glasses.

620
00:50:07,959 --> 00:50:09,041
Oh, right. Fuck.

621
00:50:24,042 --> 00:50:28,041
Language opens the door
to the subconscious.

622
00:50:28,251 --> 00:50:29,833
Freud was a great writer.

623
00:50:30,042 --> 00:50:33,041
He could be self-critical.

624
00:50:33,251 --> 00:50:36,291
He never hesitated
to revise his theories.

625
00:50:36,501 --> 00:50:40,625
He viewed each individual patient
as a research subject.

626
00:50:40,834 --> 00:50:44,208
Freud didn't distinguish between
therapy and research.

627
00:50:44,459 --> 00:50:47,583
I find that very compelling.

628
00:50:47,792 --> 00:50:51,291
Especially these days,

629
00:50:51,501 --> 00:50:55,125
when scientific methodology
is applied

630
00:50:55,459 --> 00:50:57,916
even in the humanities.

631
00:50:58,126 --> 00:51:00,916
Enough about Freud.
How's the movie coming along?

632
00:51:01,167 --> 00:51:03,333
Isn't it almost done?

633
00:51:03,626 --> 00:51:05,250
Yeah, I've seen it, but...

634
00:51:05,459 --> 00:51:06,791
- You have?
- Yes.

635
00:51:07,084 --> 00:51:09,083
It's no longer mine at all.

636
00:51:09,292 --> 00:51:11,583
Is it as bad as you feared?

637
00:51:11,792 --> 00:51:15,500
The worst thing is how
they've housetrained Bobcat.

638
00:51:15,709 --> 00:51:19,208
It's all very sanitized and safe.

639
00:51:19,417 --> 00:51:20,625
I'll show you something.

640
00:51:22,417 --> 00:51:26,250
A mock-up of the movie poster.

641
00:51:27,126 --> 00:51:28,291
I have to admit...

642
00:51:28,584 --> 00:51:31,125
I'm embarrassed my name's on it.

643
00:51:31,334 --> 00:51:32,083
Shit.

644
00:51:32,501 --> 00:51:34,000
No! Seriously?

645
00:51:34,209 --> 00:51:36,333
You must be kidding. No way.

646
00:51:36,709 --> 00:51:39,541
That's the poster. For real.

647
00:51:40,501 --> 00:51:42,083
Let's see.

648
00:51:42,292 --> 00:51:44,166
Looks like Chip and Dale.

649
00:51:44,376 --> 00:51:45,083
Holy shit.

650
00:51:45,709 --> 00:51:47,500
Should I laugh or cry?

651
00:51:48,084 --> 00:51:51,916
Everything was butchered.
The story. All the details.

652
00:51:52,876 --> 00:51:54,666
They removed the starfish.

653
00:51:54,876 --> 00:51:56,666
Sorry, I'm lost.

654
00:51:56,876 --> 00:51:58,083
What starfish?

655
00:51:58,292 --> 00:52:00,125
It's, you know...

656
00:52:00,334 --> 00:52:01,916
the butthole. The anus.

657
00:52:02,126 --> 00:52:04,208
His butt is smooth in the movie.

658
00:52:05,042 --> 00:52:07,375
This thing is gone.

659
00:52:07,834 --> 00:52:09,708
That's bad in my book.

660
00:52:09,917 --> 00:52:12,125
In underground comics you shit,

661
00:52:12,334 --> 00:52:15,791
you puke, you fuck and all that stuff.

662
00:52:16,001 --> 00:52:21,125
Bobcat is a wild cat
in a world of domestic cats.

663
00:52:21,334 --> 00:52:23,625
He's a rebel against the bourgeoisie.

664
00:52:23,834 --> 00:52:26,541
One of the most iconic buttholes ever.

665
00:53:05,459 --> 00:53:06,458
Coffee?

666
00:53:06,667 --> 00:53:07,500
Yeah.

667
00:56:39,792 --> 00:56:41,833
I don't know what we should do.

668
00:57:15,126 --> 00:57:16,541
I have to go.

669
00:58:32,501 --> 00:58:33,541
Aksel,

670
00:58:33,959 --> 00:58:35,375
we need to talk.

671
00:58:37,251 --> 00:58:38,791
Yeah, of course.

672
00:58:40,167 --> 00:58:40,916
What's wrong?

673
00:58:41,959 --> 00:58:44,250
<i>Julie said she'd been thinking.</i>

674
00:58:44,792 --> 00:58:48,000
<i>It wasn't his fault.
Nothing he could have changed.</i>

675
00:58:48,209 --> 00:58:50,458
It's not anything you've done.

676
00:58:51,042 --> 00:58:53,666
It's not your fault. But I feel...

677
00:58:53,917 --> 00:58:56,458
<i>It was about
all their old arguments.</i>

678
00:58:57,042 --> 00:58:58,541
<i>Things they both knew.</i>

679
00:58:58,751 --> 00:59:00,000
<i>It was bad timing.</i>

680
00:59:00,209 --> 00:59:02,916
<i>They'd met in different phases of life.</i>

681
00:59:03,126 --> 00:59:05,250
<i>They wanted different things.</i>

682
00:59:05,459 --> 00:59:07,666
We want different things.

683
00:59:14,501 --> 00:59:16,375
Are you leaving me?

684
00:59:17,042 --> 00:59:17,916
Yeah.

685
00:59:20,834 --> 00:59:22,875
I want it to be over.

686
00:59:49,459 --> 00:59:53,166
Are you sure you're yourself right now?

687
00:59:54,001 --> 00:59:55,041
What do you mean?

688
00:59:55,334 --> 00:59:57,625
Do you realize...

689
00:59:58,292 --> 01:00:01,250
Do you realize what you're doing?

690
01:00:01,501 --> 01:00:03,125
What you're destroying?

691
01:00:03,334 --> 01:00:05,250
Yes, of course.

692
01:00:06,209 --> 01:00:08,083
That's why it's so hard.

693
01:00:15,709 --> 01:00:16,833
Where will you live?

694
01:00:18,584 --> 01:00:19,791
I don't know.

695
01:00:20,126 --> 01:00:21,291
You don't know?

696
01:00:22,001 --> 01:00:23,041
No. With Mom.

697
01:00:28,167 --> 01:00:29,166
Move home to Mom?

698
01:00:30,167 --> 01:00:32,250
Yeah. Until I find a place.

699
01:00:34,751 --> 01:00:35,625
Okay.

700
01:00:41,709 --> 01:00:43,333
No, come on...

701
01:00:46,042 --> 01:00:47,375
It's over.

702
01:00:48,834 --> 01:00:51,875
I've had it. What else can I say?

703
01:00:52,167 --> 01:00:55,958
Is something else bothering you
and you're venting on me?

704
01:00:56,251 --> 01:00:56,916
No.

705
01:00:57,334 --> 01:00:59,166
I've thought about it for a long time.

706
01:00:59,959 --> 01:01:01,875
It feels right.

707
01:01:06,626 --> 01:01:08,083
Have you met someone?

708
01:01:08,584 --> 01:01:09,541
No.

709
01:01:16,126 --> 01:01:19,000
I'm so sick of all this, Julie.
Dammit.

710
01:01:19,209 --> 01:01:20,583
Sick to death of it.

711
01:01:23,626 --> 01:01:25,583
But okay.

712
01:01:26,042 --> 01:01:28,208
Just leave. If that's what you want.

713
01:01:31,167 --> 01:01:33,833
I'll take a walk while you pack.

714
01:02:01,167 --> 01:02:04,541
<i>Julie said he deserved
a more grounded woman.</i>

715
01:02:05,417 --> 01:02:07,000
<i>Ready for children.</i>

716
01:02:07,459 --> 01:02:08,583
<i>Who was dependable,</i>

717
01:02:08,792 --> 01:02:11,750
<i>didn't flake out every six months.</i>

718
01:02:14,292 --> 01:02:16,833
But I like you flaky.

719
01:02:17,042 --> 01:02:19,041
<i>Aksel said he liked her flaky.</i>

720
01:02:19,792 --> 01:02:22,458
<i>That he needed someone like that.</i>

721
01:02:22,876 --> 01:02:25,375
<i>Who could draw him out
of his drawing board.</i>

722
01:02:26,209 --> 01:02:28,875
And as for having kids...

723
01:02:31,709 --> 01:02:34,458
<i>He said
he'd rather be childless with her</i>

724
01:02:34,667 --> 01:02:36,500
<i>than have kids with anyone else.</i>

725
01:02:37,251 --> 01:02:39,333
You know that's not the only problem.

726
01:02:40,001 --> 01:02:41,666
So what is the problem?

727
01:02:43,542 --> 01:02:47,625
It's a combination of things,
not just that.

728
01:02:48,001 --> 01:02:51,791
I can see you're in a crisis right now.

729
01:02:52,001 --> 01:02:53,958
I can understand that.

730
01:02:54,542 --> 01:02:57,250
But if you love me,

731
01:02:58,376 --> 01:02:59,875
we'll sort it all out.

732
01:03:00,084 --> 01:03:01,583
Yes, I do love you.

733
01:03:02,417 --> 01:03:03,958
And I don't love you.

734
01:03:04,834 --> 01:03:07,208
<i>Julie felt that this sentence,</i>

735
01:03:07,417 --> 01:03:08,916
<i>the way she said it,</i>

736
01:03:09,126 --> 01:03:10,416
<i>her emphasis on certain words,</i>

737
01:03:10,626 --> 01:03:13,708
<i>summed up the impossibility of it all.</i>

738
01:03:13,917 --> 01:03:16,916
I feel like a spectator in my own life.

739
01:03:18,626 --> 01:03:21,875
Like I'm playing a supporting role
in my own life.

740
01:03:27,959 --> 01:03:30,041
I get that you feel stuck.

741
01:03:30,251 --> 01:03:32,958
You need a change.

742
01:03:33,167 --> 01:03:35,291
But is this the solution?

743
01:03:36,001 --> 01:03:38,500
This is exactly my point.

744
01:03:39,042 --> 01:03:41,166
I'm trying to tell you how I feel,

745
01:03:41,376 --> 01:03:44,625
and you're defining my feelings.

746
01:03:45,501 --> 01:03:47,208
I see what you're doing.

747
01:03:47,417 --> 01:03:51,041
What am I doing?
Tell me what I'm doing.

748
01:03:51,167 --> 01:03:53,291
Shut up, and I'll tell you.

749
01:03:53,792 --> 01:03:58,083
You're acting out the confrontation
you never dared have with your father.

750
01:03:58,376 --> 01:04:02,416
- You're taking it out on me.
- Is that so?

751
01:04:03,126 --> 01:04:05,291
What do you know about it?

752
01:04:05,626 --> 01:04:08,625
This is the crux of our relationship.

753
01:04:08,834 --> 01:04:12,041
Everything we feel,
we have to put into words.

754
01:04:12,251 --> 01:04:15,291
Sometimes, I just want to feel things.

755
01:04:15,542 --> 01:04:18,958
You insist on being so
damn strong all the time.

756
01:04:19,209 --> 01:04:20,125
For you,

757
01:04:20,334 --> 01:04:22,708
being strong

758
01:04:22,917 --> 01:04:24,833
is about formulating things.

759
01:04:25,042 --> 01:04:27,125
If you analyze things

760
01:04:27,334 --> 01:04:29,666
at every psychological level,

761
01:04:29,876 --> 01:04:31,375
you think you're strong.

762
01:04:31,584 --> 01:04:35,416
Because I'm less analytical,
you think I'm weaker.

763
01:04:40,667 --> 01:04:42,750
<i>She said she was terrified
of being alone.</i>

764
01:04:42,959 --> 01:04:44,625
<i>Terrified of living without him.</i>

765
01:04:44,834 --> 01:04:46,666
<i>That when she left,</i>

766
01:04:47,042 --> 01:04:49,291
<i>she'd be like Bambi on the ice.</i>

767
01:04:50,459 --> 01:04:53,916
<i>And that was precisely
why she had to do it.</i>

768
01:04:55,959 --> 01:04:59,625
<i>Aksel mumbled soothing words
she didn't hear.</i>

769
01:04:59,876 --> 01:05:01,666
<i>She was thinking about how,</i>

770
01:05:01,876 --> 01:05:05,500
<i>at the age of 30,
she'd just compared herself to Bambi.</i>

771
01:05:09,292 --> 01:05:09,958
No.

772
01:05:11,959 --> 01:05:13,416
I'm pathetic.

773
01:05:13,626 --> 01:05:14,875
No, you're not.

774
01:05:29,542 --> 01:05:30,500
Aksel...

775
01:06:12,376 --> 01:06:13,416
Hey...

776
01:06:15,834 --> 01:06:17,458
I didn't mean what I said.

777
01:06:17,751 --> 01:06:18,666
It's okay.

778
01:06:18,917 --> 01:06:20,500
I said plenty of things, too.

779
01:06:25,126 --> 01:06:26,333
Stay a little longer.

780
01:06:31,001 --> 01:06:32,708
You'll regret it.

781
01:06:35,251 --> 01:06:36,791
I'm sure I will.

782
01:06:38,251 --> 01:06:39,625
The saddest thing,

783
01:06:39,876 --> 01:06:43,916
is one day, you'll want kids.

784
01:06:44,209 --> 01:06:47,166
In any case,
you'll have other relationships.

785
01:06:48,209 --> 01:06:51,958
And you'll realize that
what we had was unique.

786
01:06:52,417 --> 01:06:53,291
I know.

787
01:06:53,501 --> 01:06:56,708
You don't. But I do.
I've had many relationships.

788
01:06:56,917 --> 01:06:58,416
I know how hard it is.

789
01:06:59,792 --> 01:07:03,041
Nobody communicates like we do.
Laughs like we do.

790
01:07:13,417 --> 01:07:17,291
Who knows?
Maybe we'll get back together someday.

791
01:07:18,167 --> 01:07:19,791
<i>Then and there...</i>

792
01:07:20,376 --> 01:07:21,500
<i>she meant it.</i>

793
01:07:22,501 --> 01:07:23,666
I mean it.

794
01:07:45,292 --> 01:07:48,416
CHAPTER 6
FINNMARK HIGHLANDS

795
01:07:59,876 --> 01:08:01,375
- Are you cold?
- Yeah.

796
01:08:05,876 --> 01:08:09,750
- It looked easier on YouTube.
- I told you we should practice.

797
01:08:13,126 --> 01:08:13,875
Wait...

798
01:08:14,126 --> 01:08:15,416
This one first.

799
01:08:15,626 --> 01:08:17,875
- Are you sure?
- Yes, this goes on top.

800
01:08:18,084 --> 01:08:20,791
Right, but is it first?

801
01:08:21,709 --> 01:08:23,083
Isn't the other one first?

802
01:08:23,292 --> 01:08:25,416
- No, that's the top.
- Okay.

803
01:09:07,001 --> 01:09:10,000
<i>Eivind turned it into a funny story
he told everyone.</i>

804
01:09:10,792 --> 01:09:12,791
<i>But it touched
something deeper in her.</i>

805
01:09:14,667 --> 01:09:17,000
<i>Awoke something in her.</i>

806
01:09:17,292 --> 01:09:18,625
<i>She googled her family name.</i>

807
01:09:18,876 --> 01:09:21,708
<i>Her grandfather came
from the Far North.</i>

808
01:09:22,959 --> 01:09:27,416
<i>The DNA sample
she sent to America confirmed it.</i>

809
01:09:32,292 --> 01:09:35,666
<i>Eivind didn't see how
her newfound identity</i>

810
01:09:35,876 --> 01:09:37,875
<i>as 3.1% Sami</i>

811
01:09:38,334 --> 01:09:42,250
<i>connected to mind-expanding substances
and unrelated exotic rituals,</i>

812
01:09:42,584 --> 01:09:45,333
<i>but tried to be supportive.</i>

813
01:09:47,292 --> 01:09:49,708
<i>As she became increasingly militant,</i>

814
01:09:49,959 --> 01:09:53,250
<i>she saw how climate change
was hurting indigenous people.</i>

815
01:09:59,126 --> 01:10:01,000
<i>Inuit starving as seals vanish.</i>

816
01:10:01,417 --> 01:10:04,333
<i>Melting ice ruining reindeer pastures.</i>

817
01:10:04,542 --> 01:10:07,791
<i>Aborigines dying of skin cancer
from the hole in the ozone.</i>

818
01:10:10,376 --> 01:10:13,333
<i>Eivind could forget
about flying to New York.</i>

819
01:10:13,834 --> 01:10:16,208
Breathe in. All the way up.

820
01:10:16,459 --> 01:10:17,875
<i>She made them live</i>

821
01:10:18,751 --> 01:10:20,166
<i>more sustainably.</i>

822
01:10:22,292 --> 01:10:24,000
<i>He could always do better.</i>

823
01:10:24,251 --> 01:10:26,333
<i>Study the ingredients more closely.</i>

824
01:10:26,542 --> 01:10:29,750
<i>Consider the environmental impact
of his purchases.</i>

825
01:10:29,959 --> 01:10:31,625
<i>Plastic is killing the oceans.</i>

826
01:10:31,876 --> 01:10:35,000
<i>Norwegian cod
was ferried to China and back.</i>

827
01:10:35,251 --> 01:10:37,625
<i>Cobalt mining was destroying the Congo.</i>

828
01:10:37,876 --> 01:10:40,041
<i>Batteries had blood on their hands.</i>

829
01:10:42,584 --> 01:10:46,291
<i>The sum of Western guilt
sat beside him on the couch.</i>

830
01:10:46,584 --> 01:10:48,375
<i>Went to bed with him at night.</i>

831
01:10:50,876 --> 01:10:53,625
<i>Everything was weighed against
the greater cause.</i>

832
01:11:10,084 --> 01:11:14,250
<i>He felt he was betraying Sunniva.
Betraying the Sami people.</i>

833
01:11:18,834 --> 01:11:23,041
<i>Felt like the world's worst person,
but couldn't resist.</i>

834
01:11:24,917 --> 01:11:27,583
I forgot my sunglasses inside.

835
01:11:28,251 --> 01:11:29,125
Right.

836
01:11:29,417 --> 01:11:30,875
Be right back.

837
01:11:39,334 --> 01:11:41,833
CHAPTER 7
A NEW CHAPTER

838
01:12:27,751 --> 01:12:29,833
<i>Eivind didn't want kids either.</i>

839
01:12:30,376 --> 01:12:34,708
<i>Climate researchers foresaw
hard times for future generations.</i>

840
01:12:34,917 --> 01:12:38,541
<i>Overpopulation was the reason
everything was falling apart.</i>

841
01:12:51,167 --> 01:12:54,083
<i>Julie liked how this pessimism
added depth</i>

842
01:12:54,417 --> 01:12:56,041
<i>to his cheerful nature.</i>

843
01:12:57,792 --> 01:13:01,291
<i>But she could tell
he had other reasons too.</i>

844
01:13:04,792 --> 01:13:06,583
<i>Eivind's father, like Julie's,</i>

845
01:13:06,792 --> 01:13:08,958
<i>tended to forget birthdays.</i>

846
01:13:09,167 --> 01:13:10,541
<i>Eivind would often say,</i>

847
01:13:10,751 --> 01:13:12,500
<i>"According to my father's calendar..."</i>

848
01:13:12,751 --> 01:13:14,333
I'm 12 years old.

849
01:13:15,417 --> 01:13:17,875
They're all hard. No ripe ones.

850
01:13:18,167 --> 01:13:19,333
People die of thirst in Chile

851
01:13:19,626 --> 01:13:22,916
because avocados need so much water.

852
01:13:43,042 --> 01:13:45,250
Still following Sunniva on Instagram?

853
01:13:47,001 --> 01:13:50,791
Yeah, she posts interesting links
about the environment.

854
01:13:52,834 --> 01:13:55,875
We don't message or anything.

855
01:13:56,167 --> 01:13:58,833
She's got over 30,000 followers.

856
01:13:59,126 --> 01:14:01,000
For showing off her ass?

857
01:14:02,709 --> 01:14:05,666
She's not showing off her ass,
she's doing yoga.

858
01:14:06,209 --> 01:14:07,291
It's yoga.

859
01:14:10,292 --> 01:14:11,750
Okay, she shows it off a bit.

860
01:14:12,334 --> 01:14:14,375
I don't mind you following her.

861
01:14:15,126 --> 01:14:16,875
It's not a problem, but...

862
01:14:18,417 --> 01:14:19,958
I don't want to be

863
01:14:21,001 --> 01:14:24,500
the sensible choice
while she's the sexy one.

864
01:14:33,126 --> 01:14:35,083
There's nothing sensible about you.

865
01:14:36,709 --> 01:14:38,166
- I mean...
- Yeah.

866
01:14:39,292 --> 01:14:43,000
- The angle of her pelvis...
- It's yoga.

867
01:14:43,584 --> 01:14:45,208
That's not yoga.

868
01:14:45,501 --> 01:14:46,250
It is yoga.

869
01:14:47,001 --> 01:14:48,083
You liked it!

870
01:14:48,751 --> 01:14:49,875
Oh, my god!

871
01:14:50,792 --> 01:14:54,291
- That's not cool!
- I had to like it!

872
01:15:02,584 --> 01:15:05,416
That's right.

873
01:15:06,292 --> 01:15:09,041
So, that's why...

874
01:15:09,417 --> 01:15:12,708
CHAPTER 8
JULIE'S NARCISSISTIC CIRCUS

875
01:15:12,917 --> 01:15:14,483
I want people to watch me dance.

876
01:15:14,667 --> 01:15:16,708
It's annoying as hell.

877
01:15:16,917 --> 01:15:21,583
You can make a fool of yourself
on the dance floor and still be cool.

878
01:15:22,876 --> 01:15:26,458
So true! I've noticed that.
When we dance,

879
01:15:26,667 --> 01:15:28,166
you take up all the space.

880
01:15:39,459 --> 01:15:40,750
Yeah, but it's also like,

881
01:15:40,959 --> 01:15:42,875
"Everyone look at me!"

882
01:15:43,167 --> 01:15:47,125
Yeah, that's my point.
You're always so mysterious.

883
01:15:53,042 --> 01:15:54,625
You still have your stash?

884
01:15:56,501 --> 01:15:57,583
What's that?

885
01:16:02,042 --> 01:16:02,875
Where'd you find it?

886
01:16:04,376 --> 01:16:05,625
What is it?

887
01:16:06,251 --> 01:16:07,416
Magic mushrooms.

888
01:16:15,751 --> 01:16:16,708
Have you tried it?

889
01:16:18,834 --> 01:16:19,875
Yeah.

890
01:16:25,709 --> 01:16:26,333
Right.

891
01:16:28,251 --> 01:16:29,375
Why'd you do that?

892
01:16:30,917 --> 01:16:31,791
Yuck.

893
01:16:32,001 --> 01:16:33,208
Tastes like dirt.

894
01:16:34,626 --> 01:16:35,500
Anyone?

895
01:17:30,667 --> 01:17:34,083
I don't feel anything.
They're probably too old.

896
01:17:35,501 --> 01:17:36,583
I gotta go.

897
01:17:36,876 --> 01:17:38,916
Are you sure? Could be risky.

898
01:17:39,417 --> 01:17:40,625
Come on, man.

899
01:17:41,084 --> 01:17:42,375
We've done this before.

900
01:17:42,584 --> 01:17:44,666
- We'll talk tomorrow.
- Call me.

901
01:17:53,751 --> 01:17:54,833
Adil?

902
01:18:04,876 --> 01:18:06,166
Can you speak?

903
01:18:15,084 --> 01:18:17,458
It's kicking in for him.

904
01:18:21,709 --> 01:18:22,458
Julie?

905
01:18:22,876 --> 01:18:24,291
Is it starting to kick in?

906
01:18:25,584 --> 01:18:26,500
You need water.

907
01:18:26,709 --> 01:18:28,041
It's important.

908
01:18:29,001 --> 01:18:30,791
You have to drink lots of water.

909
01:18:32,501 --> 01:18:34,125
Here.

910
01:18:34,501 --> 01:18:35,583
Drink it all.

911
01:18:35,917 --> 01:18:37,583
You'll be okay.

912
01:18:38,001 --> 01:18:39,708
You know I'm here for you.

913
01:18:44,959 --> 01:18:45,958
Julie?

914
01:18:46,709 --> 01:18:47,833
Drink the water.

915
01:18:58,584 --> 01:18:59,625
It's okay! I'm here!

916
01:20:10,959 --> 01:20:13,166
Julie, are you okay?

917
01:20:18,209 --> 01:20:20,583
I thought I'd make it.

918
01:20:21,501 --> 01:20:22,250
Are you okay?

919
01:21:45,084 --> 01:21:47,000
Thought we could use some coffee.

920
01:21:50,542 --> 01:21:52,541
We won't be doing that again.

921
01:21:58,334 --> 01:22:00,583
You should take a shower.

922
01:22:00,792 --> 01:22:02,166
Do I smell bad?

923
01:22:04,167 --> 01:22:06,291
- Is that...
- Oh, my god.

924
01:22:07,501 --> 01:22:09,375
Oh, my god.
I need to take a shower.

925
01:22:09,626 --> 01:22:12,000
Don't worry, it's not urgent.

926
01:22:12,209 --> 01:22:13,958
Shall I make breakfast?

927
01:22:25,584 --> 01:22:27,708
I feel I can be myself with you.

928
01:22:28,459 --> 01:22:29,750
Completely.

929
01:22:33,792 --> 01:22:35,666
You weren't yourself before?

930
01:22:36,126 --> 01:22:37,958
I was, but I felt like...

931
01:22:38,542 --> 01:22:40,083
I had to be...

932
01:22:41,209 --> 01:22:42,666
a bit...

933
01:22:42,709 --> 01:22:45,333
like I was when we first met.

934
01:22:58,959 --> 01:23:00,833
Thanks for putting up with me.

935
01:23:01,126 --> 01:23:02,541
I love you.

936
01:23:39,126 --> 01:23:42,708
CHAPTER 9
BOBCAT WRECKS XMAS

937
01:23:52,459 --> 01:23:54,850
BOBCAT WRECKS XMAS

938
01:24:15,292 --> 01:24:20,208
<i>Have you read your
old Bobcat comics since you grew up?</i>

939
01:24:20,417 --> 01:24:23,458
<i>Because in our day and age,</i>

940
01:24:23,667 --> 01:24:26,166
they seem so inappropriate and murky

941
01:24:26,376 --> 01:24:28,583
that we feel almost sick

942
01:24:28,834 --> 01:24:29,750
<i>reading them.</i>

943
01:24:30,042 --> 01:24:32,833
<i>It's unpleasant to realize
you created a character</i>

944
01:24:33,126 --> 01:24:36,125
<i>who gained popularity
at the expense of women.</i>

945
01:24:36,417 --> 01:24:37,375
<i>Okay, I get it.</i>

946
01:24:37,626 --> 01:24:40,208
You're saying art should be pleasant?

947
01:24:41,292 --> 01:24:43,250
Do you think it's art?

948
01:24:43,542 --> 01:24:47,833
I brought along
some of your early comics.

949
01:24:48,084 --> 01:24:51,166
Bobcat is one thing,
but then there's Dick Wolf Dick,

950
01:24:51,459 --> 01:24:52,958
Pedo the Parrot...

951
01:24:53,542 --> 01:24:57,875
Right, I don't really think
this is the right medium to

952
01:24:58,251 --> 01:25:00,125
explain comic book humor.

953
01:25:00,417 --> 01:25:04,375
<i>Have you ever considered that
some of your readers</i>

954
01:25:04,584 --> 01:25:07,208
<i>may have been victims
of incest or rape?</i>

955
01:25:08,542 --> 01:25:12,541
<i>Do we stop creating
because some people might feel bad?</i>

956
01:25:12,751 --> 01:25:17,833
<i>Artists get killed for drawing things
others find offensive. They're shot.</i>

957
01:25:18,084 --> 01:25:20,875
Are you comparing Mohammed caricatures

958
01:25:21,126 --> 01:25:23,458
with drawings of women with big tits?

959
01:25:23,751 --> 01:25:25,166
Or with incest?

960
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:26,541
What's your point?

961
01:25:26,751 --> 01:25:28,541
Well, yes and no.

962
01:25:28,792 --> 01:25:30,250
It's a bit of a cop-out

963
01:25:30,542 --> 01:25:33,708
<i>to claim freedom of speech
when people criticize you.</i>

964
01:25:33,917 --> 01:25:36,291
<i>We're discussing your work right now,</i>

965
01:25:36,501 --> 01:25:39,291
<i>so nobody's censoring you.</i>

966
01:25:39,667 --> 01:25:42,000
<i>As a woman, I'm upset.</i>

967
01:25:42,209 --> 01:25:45,666
<i>I'm offended,
though we're not supposed to say that.</i>

968
01:25:46,167 --> 01:25:49,875
You have a choice.
You don't have to feel offended.

969
01:25:50,126 --> 01:25:51,416
It's not a choice.

970
01:25:51,709 --> 01:25:54,541
This is very generational.

971
01:25:54,917 --> 01:25:58,166
<i>One author cannot be held
solely responsible.</i>

972
01:25:58,376 --> 01:26:02,541
<i>I think art has to be messy and free.</i>

973
01:26:02,751 --> 01:26:05,250
<i>It has to be a bit dangerous
to be fun.</i>

974
01:26:05,459 --> 01:26:09,083
I want art to be a form of therapy

975
01:26:09,334 --> 01:26:12,125
where I can express and work through

976
01:26:12,417 --> 01:26:14,166
all my unacceptable thoughts,

977
01:26:14,459 --> 01:26:17,250
all my darkest impulses.

978
01:26:17,501 --> 01:26:21,250
But you're using your male privilege

979
01:26:21,501 --> 01:26:23,666
to mock people weaker than you.

980
01:26:23,876 --> 01:26:26,250
It's hardly art, or even humor.

981
01:26:26,459 --> 01:26:28,750
Sorry, it's not
smart enough to be satire.

982
01:26:29,001 --> 01:26:30,166
But this isn't about me.

983
01:26:30,376 --> 01:26:33,375
Like, when I create something,

984
01:26:33,709 --> 01:26:35,625
it's not just me talking.

985
01:26:35,917 --> 01:26:37,541
- I know that much.
- Do you?

986
01:26:38,376 --> 01:26:42,208
<i>Let's say I draw this interview
as a cartoon.</i>

987
01:26:42,417 --> 01:26:46,458
<i>The comic version of me
might call you a whore.</i>

988
01:26:47,084 --> 01:26:50,041
<i>It doesn't mean I think that.</i>

989
01:26:50,292 --> 01:26:51,916
<i>It could be</i>

990
01:26:52,167 --> 01:26:54,833
a parody of a certain type
of insecure male...

991
01:26:55,667 --> 01:26:57,208
You used the word "whore"?

992
01:26:58,251 --> 01:26:59,875
Yes, I said "whore".

993
01:27:00,334 --> 01:27:02,291
<i>You're not interested in what I mean.</i>

994
01:27:02,542 --> 01:27:05,125
<i>Can't you see
that's crass sexualization?</i>

995
01:27:05,334 --> 01:27:08,208
I think we're on a slippery slope here.

996
01:27:08,459 --> 01:27:12,500
All you post-feminists
are so fucking self-righteous!

997
01:27:14,001 --> 01:27:16,916
<i>Thank you, Marthe Refstad
and Aksel Willmann.</i>

998
01:27:17,251 --> 01:27:19,791
<i>The term is "sex worker" now,
by the way.</i>

999
01:27:26,292 --> 01:27:29,708
CHAPTER 10
FIRST PERSON SINGULAR

1000
01:27:34,042 --> 01:27:36,000
<i>I'm happy to help!</i>

1001
01:27:58,792 --> 01:27:59,750
Long time no see!

1002
01:27:59,959 --> 01:28:02,291
- Yeah.
- How are you?

1003
01:28:02,501 --> 01:28:04,208
Okay. And you?

1004
01:28:04,501 --> 01:28:05,916
I'm good.

1005
01:28:07,417 --> 01:28:10,041
Do you ever talk to Aksel?

1006
01:28:10,251 --> 01:28:11,458
Is he okay?

1007
01:28:12,001 --> 01:28:12,833
Yeah, well...

1008
01:28:13,417 --> 01:28:16,125
I heard the radio interview.

1009
01:28:16,334 --> 01:28:17,208
Yeah.

1010
01:28:17,876 --> 01:28:19,333
He went a bit far.

1011
01:28:25,126 --> 01:28:26,833
He's not doing that well.

1012
01:28:28,126 --> 01:28:30,041
Did you know he's sick?

1013
01:28:31,876 --> 01:28:32,708
Aksel?

1014
01:28:32,917 --> 01:28:34,125
Haven't you heard?

1015
01:28:34,334 --> 01:28:35,625
He has cancer.

1016
01:28:37,084 --> 01:28:39,500
Sorry, I thought you knew.

1017
01:28:40,542 --> 01:28:42,125
It spread quickly.

1018
01:28:42,334 --> 01:28:44,791
They discovered it too late.

1019
01:28:45,001 --> 01:28:45,708
Cancer?

1020
01:28:46,292 --> 01:28:48,333
Pancreatic.

1021
01:28:54,042 --> 01:28:55,208
But...

1022
01:29:00,001 --> 01:29:01,666
How is he coping?

1023
01:29:02,042 --> 01:29:04,666
Pretty well, under the circumstances.

1024
01:29:04,876 --> 01:29:06,250
But it's hard.

1025
01:29:06,709 --> 01:29:08,333
The prognosis

1026
01:29:09,542 --> 01:29:11,416
is not good.

1027
01:29:11,626 --> 01:29:12,833
It's incurable.

1028
01:29:25,709 --> 01:29:27,541
Thanks for letting me know.

1029
01:29:27,751 --> 01:29:29,875
I thought you knew.

1030
01:29:30,959 --> 01:29:32,750
No, I hadn't heard anything.

1031
01:29:34,209 --> 01:29:35,333
It's just...

1032
01:29:37,209 --> 01:29:38,958
I didn't know.

1033
01:30:22,376 --> 01:30:23,666
When did you write this?

1034
01:30:25,584 --> 01:30:26,750
Have you read it?

1035
01:30:27,001 --> 01:30:29,625
I was moving it to paper recycling.

1036
01:30:31,209 --> 01:30:32,291
It's very good.

1037
01:30:33,959 --> 01:30:35,083
You think?

1038
01:30:35,584 --> 01:30:36,916
Yeah, it sucked me right in.

1039
01:30:37,584 --> 01:30:39,541
It's really, really great.

1040
01:30:40,042 --> 01:30:42,125
I mean...

1041
01:30:43,834 --> 01:30:44,875
It's like...

1042
01:30:46,917 --> 01:30:47,541
What?

1043
01:30:47,792 --> 01:30:49,083
Well...

1044
01:30:53,084 --> 01:30:54,541
I have to say,

1045
01:30:54,792 --> 01:30:56,875
it's really nice to read about you.

1046
01:30:58,334 --> 01:31:00,166
But it's not about me.

1047
01:31:01,209 --> 01:31:04,750
But the Christmas scene
is your family, right?

1048
01:31:06,167 --> 01:31:08,791
Yeah, but it's fiction.
You didn't get that?

1049
01:31:09,042 --> 01:31:10,208
I made it up.

1050
01:31:10,417 --> 01:31:12,583
Okay, it's fiction.
In any case...

1051
01:31:15,626 --> 01:31:18,291
- It's good.
- Because it's me?

1052
01:31:18,501 --> 01:31:21,291
No, because it's nice.

1053
01:31:21,501 --> 01:31:22,541
"Nice"?

1054
01:31:24,792 --> 01:31:27,250
Yeah, nice. Good.
Well written.

1055
01:31:27,751 --> 01:31:31,375
The way you write
is really great.

1056
01:31:33,209 --> 01:31:34,416
Like here:

1057
01:31:34,709 --> 01:31:39,333
"Too many memories overlapping,
blending into a blur."

1058
01:31:39,626 --> 01:31:43,916
That resonates with me.
It's well written. Truly good.

1059
01:31:44,876 --> 01:31:46,250
It's not well written.

1060
01:31:48,876 --> 01:31:49,750
What's wrong?

1061
01:31:49,959 --> 01:31:53,333
Suddenly you're into literature?

1062
01:31:54,876 --> 01:31:57,166
What was the last book you read?

1063
01:32:00,334 --> 01:32:02,500
- Are you okay? What's up?
- Why?

1064
01:32:03,376 --> 01:32:06,041
You criticize
everything I do these days.

1065
01:32:06,334 --> 01:32:10,041
Sorry, but going through my trash
is pretty invasive.

1066
01:32:11,834 --> 01:32:13,875
- Can't you see that?
- Relax.

1067
01:32:14,126 --> 01:32:15,458
- "Relax"?
- Calm down.

1068
01:32:15,751 --> 01:32:17,666
Relaxing is your specialty!

1069
01:32:17,959 --> 01:32:20,750
You don't mind
serving coffee till you're 50.

1070
01:32:21,042 --> 01:32:22,083
But I want more!

1071
01:32:32,126 --> 01:32:34,666
That's hurtful.
I don't know what to say.

1072
01:33:00,542 --> 01:33:04,750
CHAPTER 11
POSITIVE

1073
01:33:31,959 --> 01:33:33,083
Hello?

1074
01:33:45,126 --> 01:33:46,083
Hey...

1075
01:33:51,626 --> 01:33:52,750
Have you eaten?

1076
01:33:52,959 --> 01:33:55,625
Yeah, but I can make pasta if you like.

1077
01:33:55,834 --> 01:33:58,250
No, I don't need any if you've eaten.

1078
01:35:41,751 --> 01:35:42,833
Oops, sorry.

1079
01:35:58,042 --> 01:35:59,875
It started with a backache.

1080
01:36:00,959 --> 01:36:03,625
I've had backaches before.
I didn't worry.

1081
01:36:04,626 --> 01:36:08,083
Then my skin turned almost golden.

1082
01:36:10,501 --> 01:36:11,583
I thought I looked good.

1083
01:36:13,251 --> 01:36:15,041
It turned out to be jaundice.

1084
01:36:18,334 --> 01:36:22,125
Mom said I was born jaundiced.
They put me in a light box.

1085
01:36:23,542 --> 01:36:24,416
Is it painful?

1086
01:36:25,417 --> 01:36:26,666
No, not really.

1087
01:36:26,959 --> 01:36:28,291
It's okay.

1088
01:36:29,167 --> 01:36:33,083
They block selected
neural pathways with Botox.

1089
01:36:34,417 --> 01:36:35,208
That's good.

1090
01:36:35,501 --> 01:36:39,333
Yeah, it keeps me from taking
too many painkillers.

1091
01:36:45,084 --> 01:36:46,833
How's your family doing?

1092
01:36:47,626 --> 01:36:48,791
Fine, I guess.

1093
01:36:49,209 --> 01:36:51,125
Mom still follows your every move.

1094
01:36:53,501 --> 01:36:54,625
And your dad?

1095
01:36:57,501 --> 01:36:59,375
I've basically cut him off.

1096
01:36:59,709 --> 01:37:00,666
Good.

1097
01:37:02,084 --> 01:37:04,041
He can chase me if he likes.

1098
01:37:04,292 --> 01:37:05,291
Does he?

1099
01:37:05,542 --> 01:37:07,333
No, not really.

1100
01:37:08,501 --> 01:37:09,416
Two coffees.

1101
01:37:10,667 --> 01:37:12,875
They thought it was hilarious.

1102
01:37:13,126 --> 01:37:15,375
In some circumstances,

1103
01:37:15,626 --> 01:37:18,324
morbid humour can be funny.

1104
01:37:18,626 --> 01:37:20,860
Even anal sex at a bar mitzvah?

1105
01:37:21,167 --> 01:37:24,250
It makes me laugh.
But I'm an old guy now.

1106
01:37:24,501 --> 01:37:25,500
No.

1107
01:37:25,792 --> 01:37:27,208
Well, you know...

1108
01:37:27,834 --> 01:37:29,458
I kind of expected this.

1109
01:37:29,667 --> 01:37:32,833
I'd given up long before I got sick.

1110
01:37:34,417 --> 01:37:38,791
Really. I just watch
my favourite old movies over and over.

1111
01:37:39,042 --> 01:37:43,125
Lynch, <i>The Godfather Part II</i>...

1112
01:37:43,376 --> 01:37:45,000
How many times can you watch

1113
01:37:45,667 --> 01:37:47,083
<i>Dog Day Afternoon</i>?

1114
01:37:47,292 --> 01:37:48,416
Many times!

1115
01:37:51,792 --> 01:37:52,708
You should.

1116
01:37:53,459 --> 01:37:54,458
Absolutely.

1117
01:37:57,667 --> 01:37:59,916
Sometimes I listen to music...

1118
01:38:00,709 --> 01:38:02,125
I haven't heard before.

1119
01:38:02,834 --> 01:38:04,166
But...

1120
01:38:05,042 --> 01:38:06,875
It's old as well.

1121
01:38:08,292 --> 01:38:12,250
Music I didn't know about,
but from when I grew up.

1122
01:38:13,251 --> 01:38:15,958
It felt as though I'd already given up.

1123
01:38:18,084 --> 01:38:22,541
I grew up in an age
without Internet and mobile phones.

1124
01:38:24,834 --> 01:38:27,166
No, but honestly...

1125
01:38:27,709 --> 01:38:30,875
I sound like an old fart.
But I think about it a lot.

1126
01:38:31,917 --> 01:38:35,083
The world that I knew...

1127
01:38:36,209 --> 01:38:37,958
has disappeared.

1128
01:38:38,167 --> 01:38:41,375
For me it was all about going to stores.

1129
01:38:42,001 --> 01:38:45,250
Record stores.

1130
01:38:47,667 --> 01:38:50,416
I'd take the tram
to Voices record store in Grünerløkka.

1131
01:38:50,751 --> 01:38:53,375
Leaf through
used comics at Pretty Price.

1132
01:38:53,626 --> 01:38:57,625
I can close my eyes and see
the aisles at Video Nova in Majorstua.

1133
01:38:59,209 --> 01:39:01,791
I grew up in a time

1134
01:39:02,001 --> 01:39:05,333
when culture was passed along
through objects.

1135
01:39:07,042 --> 01:39:10,000
They were interesting because

1136
01:39:11,751 --> 01:39:14,083
we could live among them.

1137
01:39:14,292 --> 01:39:17,250
We could pick them up.
Hold them in our hands.

1138
01:39:17,792 --> 01:39:19,125
Compare them.

1139
01:39:19,334 --> 01:39:20,875
A bit like books?

1140
01:39:22,167 --> 01:39:23,750
Yeah, a bit like books.

1141
01:39:27,001 --> 01:39:31,333
That's all I have.
I spent my life doing that.

1142
01:39:33,209 --> 01:39:38,125
Collecting all that stuff,
comics, books...

1143
01:39:39,876 --> 01:39:41,083
And...

1144
01:39:43,167 --> 01:39:47,166
I just continued,
even when it stopped giving me

1145
01:39:48,292 --> 01:39:50,250
the powerful emotions

1146
01:39:50,459 --> 01:39:53,458
I felt in my early 20s.

1147
01:39:56,084 --> 01:39:57,916
I continued anyway.

1148
01:39:58,459 --> 01:39:59,416
And...

1149
01:40:01,001 --> 01:40:02,291
now it's all I have left.

1150
01:40:02,501 --> 01:40:07,083
Knowledge and memories
of stupid, futile things

1151
01:40:07,292 --> 01:40:10,166
nobody cares about.

1152
01:40:10,376 --> 01:40:11,875
Don't say that.

1153
01:40:12,084 --> 01:40:14,250
You've got the comics you created.

1154
01:40:15,084 --> 01:40:18,250
I wish I'd had what you had.

1155
01:40:18,459 --> 01:40:20,416
To be able to draw

1156
01:40:20,626 --> 01:40:24,583
without doubting that you're doing
what you're supposed to do.

1157
01:40:26,459 --> 01:40:29,291
I really wish I had that.

1158
01:40:29,834 --> 01:40:30,875
Yeah, but...

1159
01:40:31,209 --> 01:40:33,083
I've got cancer. I'm dying.

1160
01:40:33,292 --> 01:40:35,791
Of course I'm being retrospective.

1161
01:40:37,417 --> 01:40:40,041
You said you've done that for ages.

1162
01:40:40,251 --> 01:40:42,166
Not for that long.

1163
01:40:43,417 --> 01:40:48,041
In recent years. I reached
a point in life when suddenly...

1164
01:40:48,251 --> 01:40:49,833
It just happened.

1165
01:40:51,459 --> 01:40:53,041
When...

1166
01:40:55,876 --> 01:40:58,250
I began to worship what had been.

1167
01:41:01,001 --> 01:41:05,125
And now I have nothing else.
I have no future.

1168
01:41:07,251 --> 01:41:09,500
I can only look back.

1169
01:41:13,001 --> 01:41:14,333
And...

1170
01:41:14,584 --> 01:41:17,083
It's not even nostalgia.
It's...

1171
01:41:17,834 --> 01:41:19,250
fear of death.

1172
01:41:19,459 --> 01:41:21,541
It's because I'm scared.

1173
01:41:28,667 --> 01:41:31,166
It has nothing to do with art.

1174
01:41:31,917 --> 01:41:33,833
I'm just trying to process...

1175
01:41:45,917 --> 01:41:48,458
I have surgery tomorrow at 9.

1176
01:41:49,876 --> 01:41:53,291
<i>I felt I could tell you anything.</i>

1177
01:41:54,542 --> 01:41:56,000
<i>You wouldn't judge me.</i>

1178
01:41:56,376 --> 01:41:59,375
<i>You're the least
judgemental person I know.</i>

1179
01:42:02,584 --> 01:42:04,500
I don't have
anyone I can talk to...

1180
01:42:06,001 --> 01:42:08,375
the way we used to talk.

1181
01:42:20,959 --> 01:42:24,375
Can you tell me
what you used to tell me?

1182
01:42:25,209 --> 01:42:28,375
I hated hearing it at the time,
but can you tell me...

1183
01:42:29,167 --> 01:42:31,208
I'll be a good mother?

1184
01:42:34,667 --> 01:42:35,577
Are you pregnant?

1185
01:42:45,292 --> 01:42:46,875
Congratulations?

1186
01:42:49,459 --> 01:42:51,166
How do you feel?
Good or bad?

1187
01:42:51,376 --> 01:42:52,625
I don't know.

1188
01:42:54,126 --> 01:42:55,583
I'm not sure.

1189
01:42:57,917 --> 01:42:59,541
It was an accident.

1190
01:42:59,751 --> 01:43:03,000
I must've been careless.
I mean, clearly I was.

1191
01:43:18,542 --> 01:43:20,666
Were you really sure?

1192
01:43:22,626 --> 01:43:24,375
Sure you wanted kids?

1193
01:43:30,584 --> 01:43:34,750
I was scared, too.
I had doubts, of course.

1194
01:43:36,334 --> 01:43:40,208
But I didn't want to show them,
to keep you from...

1195
01:43:41,792 --> 01:43:45,041
I never doubted
you'd make a good mother.

1196
01:43:45,792 --> 01:43:49,250
I saw that you doubted it.

1197
01:43:50,167 --> 01:43:53,958
If I regret one thing,
it's that I never managed

1198
01:43:56,376 --> 01:44:00,791
to make you see how wonderful you are.

1199
01:44:21,542 --> 01:44:22,708
What are you thinking?

1200
01:44:26,334 --> 01:44:28,541
This is hard to hear.

1201
01:44:34,709 --> 01:44:37,541
But... will you keep it?

1202
01:44:39,459 --> 01:44:41,000
I don't know.

1203
01:44:49,792 --> 01:44:52,916
I wasted so much time

1204
01:44:53,834 --> 01:44:55,791
worrying about
what could go wrong.

1205
01:44:56,001 --> 01:44:59,958
But what did go wrong,
was never the things I worried about.

1206
01:45:02,459 --> 01:45:06,208
If he's a kind man, then go for it.

1207
01:45:07,084 --> 01:45:11,208
With a kind father,
and you as the mother,

1208
01:45:12,167 --> 01:45:13,583
everything will be fine.

1209
01:45:27,292 --> 01:45:29,625
Your voice has stayed in my head.

1210
01:45:29,917 --> 01:45:32,750
We still have great conversations.

1211
01:45:33,042 --> 01:45:33,875
No way?

1212
01:45:35,959 --> 01:45:37,125
About what?

1213
01:45:38,626 --> 01:45:41,125
Mostly about comics.

1214
01:45:43,334 --> 01:45:45,166
Eclectic tastes.

1215
01:45:54,667 --> 01:45:56,041
Same here.

1216
01:45:56,334 --> 01:45:58,708
I have imaginary conversations with you.

1217
01:46:13,417 --> 01:46:18,041
I'm sure I remember things about you
that you've forgotten.

1218
01:46:20,126 --> 01:46:21,416
And the other way round.

1219
01:46:22,376 --> 01:46:24,250
Yeah, maybe.

1220
01:46:29,084 --> 01:46:30,916
When I'm gone,

1221
01:46:31,751 --> 01:46:34,250
all that stuff about you
will go with me.

1222
01:46:45,751 --> 01:46:47,458
May I ask you
a question?

1223
01:46:49,376 --> 01:46:53,541
Had you already met him
when you broke up with me?

1224
01:46:59,667 --> 01:47:00,666
Yeah.

1225
01:47:04,126 --> 01:47:05,708
Why didn't you tell me?

1226
01:47:13,751 --> 01:47:15,041
I don't know.

1227
01:47:16,459 --> 01:47:17,750
I didn't dare.

1228
01:47:24,709 --> 01:47:27,000
And now you're breaking up with him?

1229
01:47:27,709 --> 01:47:29,375
No, why do you say that?

1230
01:47:31,042 --> 01:47:34,666
Maybe because you don't seem happy
about the baby.

1231
01:47:38,001 --> 01:47:41,250
And that's what you do
when things get tough.

1232
01:47:49,292 --> 01:47:50,958
I'm glad I'm pregnant.

1233
01:47:59,376 --> 01:48:00,541
I'm sorry.

1234
01:48:06,834 --> 01:48:07,875
It's alright.

1235
01:48:32,876 --> 01:48:35,250
You were the most important
relationship in my life.

1236
01:48:38,584 --> 01:48:40,750
You don't have to say anything.

1237
01:48:41,417 --> 01:48:44,500
I know it's not the same for you.

1238
01:48:45,459 --> 01:48:49,000
That's normal.
You have many years left to live.

1239
01:48:51,751 --> 01:48:53,208
But I know,
I feel it.

1240
01:48:56,042 --> 01:48:57,791
And I want you to know.

1241
01:49:02,376 --> 01:49:04,625
You were the love of my life.

1242
01:49:20,334 --> 01:49:21,791
You're a damn good person.

1243
01:50:01,084 --> 01:50:02,500
I should've told you before.

1244
01:50:03,251 --> 01:50:04,583
But I couldn't.

1245
01:50:06,917 --> 01:50:08,291
I'm pregnant.

1246
01:50:15,459 --> 01:50:17,166
How long have you known?

1247
01:50:18,917 --> 01:50:20,875
I know we don't want kids.

1248
01:50:21,459 --> 01:50:22,541
No...

1249
01:50:22,751 --> 01:50:25,458
I don't know if I do.

1250
01:50:27,751 --> 01:50:31,250
I feel like I never see anything through.

1251
01:50:31,459 --> 01:50:34,958
I go from one thing to another.

1252
01:50:43,584 --> 01:50:45,958
I need time

1253
01:50:47,167 --> 01:50:48,541
to think about all this.

1254
01:50:49,084 --> 01:50:50,375
About us.

1255
01:51:11,417 --> 01:51:12,791
It's okay.

1256
01:51:24,084 --> 01:51:28,416
CHAPTER 12
EVERYTHING COMES TO AN END

1257
01:51:39,959 --> 01:51:41,083
That's where I lived.

1258
01:51:44,584 --> 01:51:46,333
We moved there when I was 8.

1259
01:51:48,501 --> 01:51:49,791
Shall we knock?

1260
01:51:50,376 --> 01:51:51,916
No. I don't think so.

1261
01:52:18,167 --> 01:52:21,083
<i>What do you remember from here?</i>

1262
01:52:30,167 --> 01:52:32,250
<i>I remember these colours.</i>

1263
01:52:38,459 --> 01:52:40,958
<i>They were always my reference</i>

1264
01:52:41,334 --> 01:52:43,041
when I drew my comics.

1265
01:52:43,792 --> 01:52:45,250
These colours.

1266
01:52:51,834 --> 01:52:53,416
<i>And I remember</i>

1267
01:52:54,376 --> 01:52:57,583
<i>the local drunk,
who was super nice.</i>

1268
01:53:42,751 --> 01:53:45,625
I'm so tired of pretending
everything is okay.

1269
01:53:57,334 --> 01:54:00,458
It sucks being in so much pain.
It sucks.

1270
01:54:01,251 --> 01:54:02,958
Everything sucks.

1271
01:54:05,417 --> 01:54:06,250
And...

1272
01:54:08,542 --> 01:54:11,375
I don't want to be a memory for you.

1273
01:54:12,542 --> 01:54:15,250
I don't want to be a voice in your head.

1274
01:54:16,667 --> 01:54:19,750
I don't want to live on through my art.

1275
01:54:26,376 --> 01:54:28,750
I want to live in my flat.

1276
01:54:30,917 --> 01:54:32,000
I want to live...

1277
01:54:36,376 --> 01:54:38,583
I want to live in my flat with you.

1278
01:54:39,542 --> 01:54:41,125
I want to be happy together.

1279
01:55:26,959 --> 01:55:27,958
Bye.

1280
01:55:28,501 --> 01:55:29,625
Bye.

1281
01:55:29,917 --> 01:55:31,000
<i>Hi, Julie.</i>

1282
01:55:31,584 --> 01:55:34,458
<i>Aksel's condition has suddenly worsened.</i>

1283
01:55:35,167 --> 01:55:38,416
<i>He's too ill for his planned treatment.</i>

1284
01:55:38,709 --> 01:55:41,791
<i>He may not make it through the night.</i>

1285
01:55:42,459 --> 01:55:46,166
<i>His family is with him,
but I thought you should know.</i>

1286
01:58:33,542 --> 01:58:37,125
EPILOGUE

1287
01:58:37,542 --> 01:58:39,125
There's nothing more to say.

1288
01:59:00,626 --> 01:59:01,375
Cut!

1289
01:59:01,876 --> 01:59:02,666
One more.

1290
01:59:02,876 --> 01:59:05,875
One more quick take.
Slight adjustment.

1291
01:59:06,542 --> 01:59:07,708
Be sadder.

1292
01:59:07,917 --> 01:59:08,833
Okay.

1293
01:59:09,042 --> 01:59:10,791
But he gets up so quickly.

1294
01:59:11,126 --> 01:59:12,333
Hey!

1295
01:59:13,334 --> 01:59:15,666
Okay, camera ready.

1296
01:59:17,376 --> 01:59:18,375
Action!

1297
01:59:18,626 --> 01:59:19,983
There's nothing more to say.

1298
01:59:38,917 --> 01:59:40,541
Cut! Great.

1299
01:59:41,167 --> 01:59:42,083
Let's move on.

1300
01:59:43,167 --> 01:59:44,375
Right, stills.

1301
01:59:48,834 --> 01:59:50,875
Sorry, I need some shots of you.

1302
01:59:52,917 --> 01:59:54,208
- Sure. Here?
- Yeah.

1303
01:59:59,876 --> 02:00:01,708
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1304
02:00:05,084 --> 02:00:07,291
But I think I was pretty terrible.

1305
02:00:09,459 --> 02:00:12,208
Then use that.
Hold on to that feeling.

1306
02:00:12,834 --> 02:00:15,250
Act like you're looking at him.
